# SSIS ETL Bank System with Power BI Reporting

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for a banking system, alongside using Power BI for reporting and visualizations. The goal is to extract data from various banking data sources, transform it to meet business requirements, and load it into a data warehouse for reporting and analysis.

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline:**  
  Extracts data from multiple banking systems (e.g., customer data, transactions, loans, etc.) and transforms it for consistency and accuracy.

- **Data Warehouse:**  
  The transformed data is loaded into a centralized data warehouse built on SQL Server for easy querying and reporting.

- **Reporting with Power BI:**  
  Power BI dashboards and reports are created to visualize key metrics such as account balances, transaction volumes, loan performance, and customer behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services):**  
  To handle the ETL process of extracting, transforming, and loading data.

- **SQL Server:**  
  For data storage and warehousing.

- **Power BI:**  
  To create interactive reports and dashboards based on the data in the warehouse.

- **SQL:**  
  Used for querying and managing data.
